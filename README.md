Bose Webpage Project

This project is a responsive webpage layout for a website featuring Bose products. It includes a modern design, clean code structure, and is optimized for performance and responsiveness.

Technologies Used
1. HTML
The project is structured using semantic HTML, ensuring the content is well-organized and accessible.
Uses section, header, nav, main, and footer tags to properly define sections of the webpage.
2. CSS / SCSS
CSS is used for styling the webpage, ensuring responsiveness and consistency across devices.
SCSS (Sass) is used to manage the CSS more effectively with features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which allow for better modularity and reusability in the styles.
3. Responsive Design
The webpage is fully responsive, designed using a grid system that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. Grid Layout
The project uses CSS Grid to create complex and responsive layouts efficiently. This enables the placement of different content blocks in an organized manner, especially for the product showcase sections.
